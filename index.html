            (You need a 3DS with homebrew and/or CFW to extract saves for this. If that doesn't make sense to you, google it or something. Citra saves also work.)

            More functionality might come someday, but it might also not come someday.

        <div class="box">
            This part just shows information about the loaded save to help convince you that it works.<br />
            If this data looks wrong, then there's something <i>different</i> about your save and it might not work if you edit it. (It might, though; you're welcome to try)<br />
            If you report issues, PLEASE UPLOAD YOUR SAVE or I will not help you.<br />
            (Note: kaiser/templar/yokai may be wrong because I haven't unlocked them yet to verify)
